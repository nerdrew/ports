description     Debugger for scripts written in ZSH

long_description \
    zshdb is a script debugger for ZSH that follows the GNU Project Debugger \
    (GDB) command syntax. zshdb can run your script, stop it on specified \
    conditions, help you examine what has happened when it has stopped, and \
    allow you to modify parts of your script so that you can experiment with \
    your code and fix problems once they are identified.
